I currently live in Sydney. I love to play around with data, be it reading a blog or signing in for a newsletter, I am always up for it. Industries such as Telecommunication, Healthcare, Banking excite me by and I want to help business take informed decisions with the help of cardinal statistical models by narrating the findings in the form of a story which everyone likes to listen.

When I am not building awesome models, I usually go for a run/swim. To keep up with the world in civilized manner Reddit is my go to social media platform.

I am also into Alternative Rock, Sports, Travelling and Caffeine.
